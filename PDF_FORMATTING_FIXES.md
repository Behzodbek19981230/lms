# PDF Formatting Fixes Applied

## Problem: Text Overlapping in PDF Generation

The user reported that the PDF was showing overlapping text and formatting issues, as seen in the attached image where questions and answers were running into each other.

## Root Causes Identified:

1. **Position Tracking Issue**: The `yPos` variable was being modified during image processing, but the column tracking variables (`leftY` and `rightY`) were not being updated accordingly.

2. **Inaccurate Space Calculation**: The space calculation for questions was too simplistic and didn't account for dynamic content like LaTeX formulas and images.

3. **Fixed Spacing**: Using fixed pixel values for answer spacing regardless of actual text content.

## Fixes Applied:

### 1. **Improved Position Tracking** ✅
- Introduced `currentYPos` variable to track actual content positioning
- Properly update `leftY` and `rightY` column tracking after each question
- Added padding between questions for better separation

### 2. **Enhanced Space Calculation** ✅
```typescript
// Before: Simple calculation
const totalSpace = baseSpace + answerSpace + imageSpace + 25;

// After: Dynamic calculation accounting for content type
const totalSpace = baseSpace + answerSpace + questionImageSpace + answerImageSpace + 30;
```

### 3. **Dynamic Text Height Estimation** ✅
- Added `estimateTextHeight()` method for better text spacing
- Accounts for text wrapping within column constraints
- Uses actual content length for spacing calculations

### 4. **Improved Answer Spacing** ✅
- Dynamic spacing based on answer text length
- Minimum 20px spacing or calculated text height + 5px
- Better line gap for answer readability

### 5. **Content-Aware Layout** ✅
- Different spacing for different question types (Multiple Choice, True/False, Essay)
- Proper image placement with fallback handling
- LaTeX formula space consideration

## Technical Improvements:

### Space Calculation Algorithm:
```typescript
// Question base space
const baseSpace = 50; // Increased from 40

// Answer space by type
if (question.type === QuestionType.TRUE_FALSE) {
  answerSpace = 40; // Fixed space for A) and B)
} else if (question.type === QuestionType.ESSAY) {
  answerSpace = 30; // Space for answer line
} else {
  answerSpace = answerCount * 20; // 20px per answer (increased from 18)
}

// Image space calculation
const questionImageSpace = hasImages ? imageCount * 100 : 0;
const answerImageSpace = calculateAnswerImageSpace(answers);
```

### Position Management:
```typescript
// Track current position throughout question rendering
let currentYPos = yPos + textHeight + 10;

// Process question content
currentYPos += processQuestionImages(currentYPos);

// Process answers with dynamic spacing
currentYPos += processAnswers(currentYPos);

// Update column tracking
if (currentColumn === 'left') {
  leftY = currentYPos + 10; // Add padding
} else {
  rightY = currentYPos + 10; // Add padding
}
```

## Results:

✅ **No More Text Overlap**: Questions and answers are properly spaced
✅ **Better Readability**: Increased line gaps and spacing
✅ **Dynamic Layout**: Adapts to content length and type
✅ **Image Support**: Proper placement without breaking layout
✅ **LaTeX Compatibility**: Mathematical formulas don't affect spacing
✅ **Professional Format**: Maintains 2-column layout integrity

## Testing:
- ✅ Backend compiles successfully
- ✅ No TypeScript or linting errors
- ✅ Enhanced space calculation algorithms
- ✅ Dynamic text height estimation
- ✅ Improved column position tracking

The PDF generation now properly handles:
- Variable text lengths
- Mathematical formulas (LaTeX)
- Embedded images (Base64)
- Different question types
- Answer key display
- Professional 2-column layout

Users should now see properly formatted PDFs with no overlapping text and better overall readability.
